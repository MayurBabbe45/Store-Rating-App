# Contributing to Store Rating Platform

Thanks for your interest in contributing! A few simple guidelines to get you started.

1. Fork the repository and create a branch for your change: `feature/your-name-does-thing`.
2. Keep changes small and focused. One feature or fix per pull request.
3. Follow existing code style (Tailwind + DaisyUI for UI components). Run `npm run lint` in `client/` before opening PR.
4. Write a short description for your pull request explaining why the change is needed.
5. If you add or change environment variables, update `server/.env.example`.

If you're adding a bigger feature, open an issue first so we can discuss design and scope.
